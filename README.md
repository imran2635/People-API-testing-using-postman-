# people-api

Hello 👋🏻,

This is a REST API with that simulates a simple people record database. Post following the setup
instructions, you may want to play around with the API's in either swagger or with the provided
postman collections in `/postman` folder. Enjoy and happy testing.

## Tech stack

Uses Flask, Connexion, Swagger and SQL Alchemy

## Setup

- Ensure you have pipenv available. Read this
  [blog](https://automationhacks.io/2020/07/12/how-to-manage-your-python-virtualenvs-with-pipenv/)
  to understand all about pipenv
- Ensure you have cloned this repo and are in the project root directory that has the `Pipfile` with
  definitions of all required dependencies.
- Execute `pipenv shell` to activate the virtualenv in your terminal
- Execute `pipenv install` to install all dependencies
- cd to `people-api`
- python 'build_database.py' to connect database
- Execute `python server.py`
- To open swagger navigate to `http://0.0.0.0:5000/api/ui/`

> On a windows machine, you may want to replace the host as `127.0.0.1` in above URL

## Project structure

- `server.py` has the code to start the Flask app with connexion
- `people.py` has the implementation for CRUD operations of the people API
- `swagger.yml` has the swagger spec to define the route for the API while also allowing to build
  out a nice swagger documentation
- `static` dir contains the `css` and `js` files (following MVC) which define the presentation and
  the interactions with the web apps API

## Common Gotchas

- To install swagger-ui, please run `pipenv install "connexion[swagger-ui]"`. Read this
  [bug](https://github.com/zalando/connexion/issues/779) to understand about why zsh needs this to
  be quoted.
- If you are on windows platform, 
  - Try using `127.0.0.1` as the host instead of `0.0.0.0`
  - Also enclose the URL in CURL with double quotes instead of single quotes (Reference thread on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6884669/curl-1-protocol-https-not-supported-or-disabled-in-libcurl/24232441#24232441))
